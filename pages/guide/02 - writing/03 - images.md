# Images

Thanks to SvelteKit, using images is super easy, just place them inside the `static/` folder and they will be accessible at the root of your domain.

Eg. if I place `logo.png` inside `static/assets/logo.png`

Then I'll be able to access it on markdown like so:

```md
![cool logo](/assets/logo.png)
```
