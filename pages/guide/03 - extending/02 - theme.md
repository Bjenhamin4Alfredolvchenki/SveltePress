# Themes

> Note: This post is mostly for theme creators

In the `components` folder you will find wrappers for the theme components (located in the `theme` folder). Those wrappers exist to ensure that users will be able to just replace the `theme` folder and not modify the whole applications.

The wrappers will pass certain data and a slot, it's you responsibility to handle them. In case you require more data from the wrappers, feel free to ask by opening an issue.
